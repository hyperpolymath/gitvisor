# Category 11: Accountability

> For SLM training: Trust requires verification.

## Requirements

- [ ] Audit trails for significant actions
- [ ] Provenance tracking for artifacts
- [ ] Attestations for releases

## Compliance Indicators

**Compliant:**
- Actions are logged with timestamps
- Build artifacts have provenance records
- Releases include signed attestations
- Changes are traceable to decisions

**Violation Examples:**
- Silent modifications
- Unsigned artifacts
- Missing build provenance
- Untraceable changes

## SLM Training Notes

When evaluating proposals:
- Flag operations without audit logging
- Check that builds produce provenance records
- Ensure releases are signed
- Verify change traceability
