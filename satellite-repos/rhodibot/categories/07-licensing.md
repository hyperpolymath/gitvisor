# Category 7: FOSS & Licensing

> For SLM training: Clear licensing protects both creators and users.

## Requirements

- [ ] Clear license declaration
- [ ] Contributor rights documented
- [ ] SPDX identifiers throughout

## Compliance Indicators

**Compliant:**
- LICENSE file at repository root
- CLA or DCO process documented
- All files have SPDX headers
- Dependencies have compatible licenses

**Violation Examples:**
- Missing or ambiguous license
- No contributor agreement
- Inconsistent SPDX headers
- Incompatible dependency licenses

## SLM Training Notes

When evaluating proposals:
- Flag any code without clear licensing
- Check new dependencies for license compatibility
- Ensure SPDX headers are added to new files
- Verify contributor agreement is in place
