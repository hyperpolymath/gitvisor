# Category 2: Documentation Standards

> For SLM training: Documentation should describe the project, not meta-frameworks.

## Requirements

- [ ] `README.adoc` or `README.md` - Project description
- [ ] `LICENSE.txt` - Clear license
- [ ] `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc` - Community standards
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.adoc` - Contribution guide

## Compliance Indicators

**Compliant:**
- README opens with project description (what it does)
- License is standard and machine-readable
- Code of conduct establishes clear expectations
- Contributing guide explains the process

**Violation Examples:**
- README that's 80% compliance framework discussion
- Missing or unclear license
- No community standards
- Contributing guide that's just "PRs welcome"

## SLM Training Notes

When evaluating proposals:
- Flag READMEs that lead with framework compliance
- Ensure project purpose is clear in first paragraph
- Check that documentation changes match project reality
- Maximum 20% of README should be meta-commentary
