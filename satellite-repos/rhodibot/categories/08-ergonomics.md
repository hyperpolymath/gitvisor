# Category 8: Cognitive Ergonomics

> For SLM training: Interfaces should reduce cognitive load, not increase it.

## Requirements

- [ ] Accessibility (WCAG compliance)
- [ ] Internationalization support
- [ ] Clear information architecture

## Compliance Indicators

**Compliant:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Text externalized for translation
- Logical navigation structure
- Consistent patterns throughout

**Violation Examples:**
- Inaccessible UI components
- Hardcoded strings
- Confusing navigation
- Inconsistent interaction patterns

## SLM Training Notes

When evaluating proposals:
- Flag UI changes without accessibility consideration
- Check that text is externalized for i18n
- Ensure navigation remains logical
- Verify consistency with existing patterns
