== Cross-Linking Strategy

=== Completed Links

* [x] README references RSR, ReScript-TEA, Palimpsest
* [x] LICENSE includes Palimpsest overlay
* [x] flake.nix follows RSR patterns

=== Pending Links

* [ ] Create CADRE router stub project
* [ ] Create Rhodibot stub project
* [ ] Find and link Valence-Shell from GitLab
* [ ] Evaluate Universal-Project-Manager overlap
* [ ] Port claude-gitlab-bridge code

== Discovery Notes

=== From GitHub (118 repos)

Repos discovered that may relate to Gitvisor:

* `7-tentacles` - Unknown, investigate
* `aletheia` - Truth/verification related?
* `Anamnesis` - Memory/history related - temporal features?
* `CIcaDA` - CI/CD related?
* `conflow` - Flow control?

=== From GitLab

Need to explore GitLab profile for additional projects.

== Integration Roadmap

=== Phase 1 (Current)

* ReScript-TEA integration
* RSR compliance
* GitHub/GitLab adapters

=== Phase 2

* Rhodibot creation and integration
* CADRE router framework
* robot-vacuum-cleaner integration

=== Phase 3

* Academic-Workflow-Suite integration
* Universal-Project-Manager evaluation
* Full CCCP integration (if CCCP scope becomes clear)

== Notes for Future Research

=== CCCP

The user mentioned "CCCP" multiple times but its definition wasn't clarified.
Need to:

1. Ask user about CCCP scope and purpose
2. Determine if it's a meta-project or framework
3. Understand how Gitvisor fits within it

=== IndieWeb Integration

The sinople-theme project mentions IndieWeb integration. Consider:

* Webmention support in Gitvisor
* Micropub endpoint for commits/issues
* h-card for user profiles
