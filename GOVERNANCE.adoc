== Overview

Gitvisor follows a transparent, community-oriented governance model based on
the TPCF (Transparent Participatory Consensus Framework) principles from the
Rhodium Standard.

== Decision Making

=== Consensus Model

* **Lazy consensus** for minor changes
* **Active consensus** for architectural decisions
* **Community vote** for breaking changes

=== Roles

==== Maintainers

* Full commit access
* Release authority
* Final say on disputes

==== Contributors

* Submit PRs and issues
* Participate in discussions
* Vote on community decisions

==== Users

* Report issues
* Request features
* Provide feedback

== Roadmap Process

1. Proposals submitted as GitHub Discussions
2. Community feedback period (minimum 7 days)
3. Maintainer review and decision
4. Implementation tracked in project board

== Conflict Resolution

1. Discussion in relevant issue/PR
2. Escalation to maintainers if needed
3. Community vote for unresolved disputes
4. External mediation as last resort

== Transparency

* All decisions documented publicly
* Financial matters disclosed (see FUNDING.yml)
* Meeting notes published when applicable

== Amendments

This governance document may be amended through the standard PR process
with extended community review (14 days minimum).
